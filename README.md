Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using the tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI).

Features:

Two-player gameplay with "X" and "O" markers.
Visual representation of the game board using buttons.
Automatic winner detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.
Tie detection when all squares are filled without a winner.
Installation:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install the tkinter library with pip install tkinter.
Running the Game:

Save the code in a Python file (e.g., tic_tac_toe.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the game using the command: python tic_tac_toe.py
Gameplay:

Players take turns clicking on empty squares on the game board.
The current player's marker ("X" or "O") will be displayed on the clicked square.
The game automatically checks for a winner after each turn.
If a winner is found, the winning squares are highlighted, and a message box announces the winner.
If all squares are filled without a winner, a message box displays "It's a tie!"
Optional (Icon Customization):

The code includes a line to set a custom icon for the game window using the icon2.png file.
Replace icon2.png with the path to your desired icon image file. Make sure the image format is compatible with tkinter.
Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
